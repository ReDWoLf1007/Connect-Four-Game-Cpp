# Connect-Four-Game-Cpp
Connect four is a unique structured game that works almost like a Tic Tac Toe game.
Player have to connect FOUR consecutive Dots to win.
If all the dots are filled it is a draw.
It is a little complex game than TIC TAC TOE in terms of codding as it requires more definitions and conditions to win.
I'm still working on it so I have not updated the code as of yet.
The Code will be provided soon.
